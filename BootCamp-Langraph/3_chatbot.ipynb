      "*   **The Mission’s Goal:** The primary goal of Apollo 11 was to land humans on the Moon and return them safely to Earth. It was a massive undertaking driven by the Cold War space race with the Soviet Union.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **The Crew:** Besides Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, the crew consisted of Michael Collins, who piloted the command module *Columbia* in orbit around the Moon, waiting for the lunar module to return.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **The Descent and First Step:** Armstrong was the first to descend to the lunar surface in the lunar module *Eagle*. The famous first step was a carefully planned moment, and Armstrong’s words, “That’s one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind,” captured the significance of the event.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Scientific Activities:** While on the Moon, Armstrong and Aldrin conducted several experiments, collected rock and soil samples (over 47 pounds!), and planted an American flag. They also deployed several scientific instruments.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **The Return:** After about 21.5 hours on the Moon’s surface, the *Eagle* rejoined *Columbia* in lunar orbit, and the crew began their journey back to Earth. They splashed down safely in the Pacific Ocean on July 24, 1969.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Why it was so important:** The Apollo 11 mission was a pivotal moment in human history, demonstrating incredible technological achievement and inspiring generations. It remains a symbol of human ambition and exploration.\n",
